## Track
* [ ] General - No Suggested Track
* [ ] Creative Communication - Talks in this track will focus on creative ways to answer the following: How do you bring colleagues up to speed on a piece of code or an entire system without launching into a lengthy monologue? Talks should delve into discussion of interesting alternative techniques used to convey dense, complicated information.
* [ ] Everything ActiveSupport! - This track will feature talks on all the interesting ways to use ActiveSupport, including the gotchas and when to avoid them. Talks could focus on topics such as what's really going on inside these methods or interesting monkey patches in your projects that you think could be a part of ActiveSupport.
* [ ] Exported Expertise - What non-tech experiences have given you an unexpected expertise in tech? This track will feature narratives about how exported expertises have helped in your tech journeys. Some examples are how working at a restaurant shaped your architectural understanding, or how caring for kids taught you to be a pull request star.
* [ ] Identiy & Permissions - Authorization is about a lot more than just ‘gem install devise’. Talks in this track can cover authorization topics including: an introduction to the fundamentals of identity & permissions, in-depth discussions about specific implementations, or delves into the security issues around authorization.
* [ ] Memorable Post-Mortems - Talks in this track will feature your favorite post-mortem stories, especially ones where you and your team learned a lot. Talks should delve into what happened, how it changed what you did going forward, and what lessons it could teach other developers.
* [ ] Mentoring for Seniors - Some devs have been in the industry for years (or even decades!) but have never had the chance or need to mentor anyone... until they did. Talks in this track will share advice on becoming a mentor, especially takeaways for anyone who is very senior at code but very junior at mentoring.
* [ ] Rails at Scale - What are teams doing to grow Rails applications beyond the first few thousand users? Talks in this track will focus on dealing with the challenges of developing an application as the load, traffic, team and application size increase. Talks should discuss the techniques, code patterns or work flows that emerged from those large applications, whether they ended up causing maintenance or performance headaches or resulted in improved productivity and throughput.
* [ ] Rails Sans ActiveRecord - Not all Rails apps run with ActiveRecord. This track will discuss various ways of using Rails either without an ORM or with a different ORM as the data layer. Talks should touch on why you chose this setup, what it specifically looks like, and how it’s working for your team!
* [ ] "Soft" Skills Are Hard! - So-called "soft" skills are actually quite difficult for many engineers, and yet, they are a vital part of a functional workplace. Things like communication, collaboration, organization, or any other "people" skills don't come naturally for many of us. Talks in this track aim to educate about non-technical -- but nevertheless vital -- aspects of the job. Talks can include favorite management and/or leadership techniques, or simply just things you wish other programmers knew that would make any workplace better.

## Abstract
##### A concise, engaging description for the public program. Limited to 600 characters.

You do not need a learning and development manager who cannot code. Educators have expertise in getting up to speed on challenging material and then teaching it to someone else.

Does your onboarding consist of a lot of talking at new eningeers? Are you looking for ideas on getting new tech hires up to speed more quickly?

Training up new engineers can be a comparitive advantage.

I used to help kids get into college, but now I make coupons you can redeem on your phone! I am not embarassed about this, rather I am resentful. 

I want to convince you to not pass up on the next teacher turned developer resume that crosses your desk.

Many jobs have spillover effects on the rest of society.

Teachers turned coders are a thing. Lets explore this phenomenon together and talk about what former educators bring to the world of software, what we can learn from them, and what this says about the state of our country.



## Details
##### Include any pertinent details such as outlines, outcomes or intended audience.

###### Objective: Participants will be able to 


__Hook__
- Getting to know the room: Raise your hand if you are a former educator.

__Argument__
- Educators make great software developers because of their expertise in three areas: communication, planning, and the ephemeral teaching sauce.

__Outline__
- Provide brief context regarding the phenomenon of educators turned coders including short personal anecdote accompanied by industry-wide statistics
| Exported Expertise | Why are Educators good at this?                                                                                    | What areas of Software Development does this strength apply? |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Communication| Part of the job of an educator is to get up to speed on challenging material and then teaching it to someone else. | Onboarding, Mentoring, Code Reviews, Technical presentations |
| Backwards Planning | Teachers plan with the end in mind - curriculum, unit and lesson planning | Project planning, handling scope creep, test driven development |
| Teaching Sauce | Many educators come from stressful, demanding, high stakes work environments. As a result educators can bring calm to tough situations and help maintain a healthy perspective at work. | Production issues, office stress |

## Pitch
##### Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic.

I have significant experience in K12 public education - at the classroom, school, and system level - prior to becoming a software developer. The students, families, teachers, and administrators I worked with dramatically shaped who I am today, and thus the way I build software. While the education sphere certainly has a lot to learn from the technology world, the learning can be bidirectional.

In particular the Rails community
