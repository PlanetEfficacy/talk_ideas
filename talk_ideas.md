## Title
Ideas:
1. Teaching Sauce
2. Confessions of a Recovering Educator
3. Dead Coders Society
4. Stand and Deliver... Software
5. School of Rails

## Session Format
Regular Session

## Track
Exported Expertise - What non-tech experiences have given you an unexpected expertise in tech? This track will feature narratives about how exported expertises have helped in your tech journeys. Some examples are how working at a restaurant shaped your architectural understanding, or how caring for kids taught you to be a pull request star.

## Abstract
##### A concise, engaging description for the public program. Limited to 600 characters. - no biographical info

How long is the line for the copy machine at your office each morning? When did a subordinate, superior or customer last yell at you? What is your company's bathroom break policy?

My status as a recovering educator may include some bitter memories, but it is not a handicap. It's a super power. Lets explore the phenomenon that is the teacher-turned-coder by looking at communication, planning and stress management practices in both school and software development contexts. You'll learn  how to harness your own teaching sauce to build better software more effectively.

## Details
##### Include any pertinent details such as outlines, outcomes or intended audience. - no biographical info

### Objective: Participants will be able to draw comparisons between teaching and programming in a way that provides them with either 1. increased awareness of their own practice or 2. next steps for improving their practice.

### Argument
- Educators make great software developers because of their expertise in:
  1. Verbal communication
  2. Written communication
  3. Planning
  4. Stress management

### Outline
#### Intro
- Provide context regarding the phenomenon of educators turned coders including short personal story accompanied by industry-wide statistics
- Introduce argument that educators make great software developers because of their expertise in verbal communication, written communication, planning and stress management
- Describe the goal of the talk: We want to bring increased mindfullness to our own practice as software developers informed by anecdotes from teachers and best practice from the field of education

#### Verbal Communication
##### How educators develop effective verbal communication
  - Facilitating and leading classroom instruction
  - Students provide quick feedback when verbal communication is ineffective
    - Anecdote of lesson gone awry
##### How verbal communication applies to software development
  - Technical presentations
  - Mentoring and onboarding new engineers
  - Explaining technical topics to technical and non technical audiences
##### Tips for improving verbal communication
  - Check for understanding
#### Written Communication
##### How educators develop effective written communication
  - Authoring student facing instructional materials
  - Grading student work
  - Again, students provide quick feedback when written communication is ineffective
##### How written communication applies to software development
  - Pull request reviews
  - Formal documentation
  - Creating clear names for variables, methods, classes
##### Tips for improving written communication
  - Empathize with your audience
#### Planning
##### How educators develop effective planning
  - Curriculum design involves goal setting and working backwards, systematically and incrementally
  - Educators plan under difficult constraints - time, student needs, external constraints (standardized testing etc)
    - Often this planning is done collaboratively with partner educators or in the context of teams of educators
##### How planning applies to software development
  - Planning complex technical projects happens collaboratively with teams of engineers, product mangers, and other stakeholders
  - Backwards planning is very similar to test driven development
##### Tips for improving planning
  - Plan with the end in mind at micro and macro scales
#### Stress Management
##### How educators develop effective stress management
  - Schools are demanding, stressful, high stakes work environments
  - Students, parents and other educators are demanding customers
##### How stress management applies to software development
  - Production bugs
  - On call rotations
##### Tips for improving planning
  - Keeping the big picture in perspective
#### Conclusion and Q&A


## Pitch
##### Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic.  - no biographical info

When I started work as a software engineer I felt like an imposter and this feeling was exacerbated by the fact that I had left a reasonably successful career in education. I knew the education world had a lot to learn from software developers, which was one of the reasons I wanted to make a change. I worried that I was too far behind my colleagues to ever make a meaningful contribution to my team or advance in my new field. What I have learned in the years since then is that I actually was not lagging behind, but rather brought strengths and previous expertise with me from my former career. I now know that the learning between educators and software developers can be bidirectional.

This talk should be on the 2020 Railsconf program because communication, planning, and stress management are hard. Understanding how these skills can be developed and practiced in a non-software context will empower participants to be more mindful of and potentially even more effective in their own practice. If a group of 2020 Railsconf attendees leave the conference with ideas on how to be better themselves or help others improve in these areas, it will have been time well spent.

I am uniquely qualified to discuss the expertise that educators bring to coding because I have significant experience in K12 public education and as a professional software developer. Prior to becoming a developer I was a middle school teacher, a middle school assistant principal, a high school assistant principal and an education consultant. During my years in education the students, families, teachers, and administrators I worked with dramatically shaped who I am today, and thus the way I build software. I am now a senior engineer. I have delivered multiple projects with significant business impact and non trivial technical complexity. I have hired, on-boarded, trained, and mentored new engineers. I bring a depth of experience in both education and software that I hope will be compelling for Railsconf attendees.

I am so excited by the prospect of telling the Rails community about my journey and what I've learned in the process.

## Bio
##### Your bio should be short, no longer than 500 characters. It's related to why you're speaking about this topic.

Jesse Spevack is a father of twins, skier, marathoner, and Senior Platform Engineer at Ibotta, a cash back for shopping app whose mission is to *make every purchase rewarding*. Before getting into the tech world, Jesse worked in public K-12 education for 11 years in teaching, school leadership, and school consulting roles. Jesse transitioned from education into technology by way of the Turing School of Software Design, a Denver based code school with a Ruby-centric curriculum and deep ties to the Rails community.
