## Title
## Session Format
* [ ] Regular Session
* [ ] Workshop
## Track
* [ ] General - No Suggested Track
* [ ] Creative Communication - Talks in this track will focus on creative ways to answer the following: How do you bring colleagues up to speed on a piece of code or an entire system without launching into a lengthy monologue? Talks should delve into discussion of interesting alternative techniques used to convey dense, complicated information.
* [ ] Everything ActiveSupport! - This track will feature talks on all the interesting ways to use ActiveSupport, including the gotchas and when to avoid them. Talks could focus on topics such as what's really going on inside these methods or interesting monkey patches in your projects that you think could be a part of ActiveSupport.
* [ ] Exported Expertise - What non-tech experiences have given you an unexpected expertise in tech? This track will feature narratives about how exported expertises have helped in your tech journeys. Some examples are how working at a restaurant shaped your architectural understanding, or how caring for kids taught you to be a pull request star.
* [ ] Identiy & Permissions - Authorization is about a lot more than just ‘gem install devise’. Talks in this track can cover authorization topics including: an introduction to the fundamentals of identity & permissions, in-depth discussions about specific implementations, or delves into the security issues around authorization.
* [ ] Memorable Post-Mortems - Talks in this track will feature your favorite post-mortem stories, especially ones where you and your team learned a lot. Talks should delve into what happened, how it changed what you did going forward, and what lessons it could teach other developers.
* [ ] Mentoring for Seniors - Some devs have been in the industry for years (or even decades!) but have never had the chance or need to mentor anyone... until they did. Talks in this track will share advice on becoming a mentor, especially takeaways for anyone who is very senior at code but very junior at mentoring.
* [ ] Rails at Scale - What are teams doing to grow Rails applications beyond the first few thousand users? Talks in this track will focus on dealing with the challenges of developing an application as the load, traffic, team and application size increase. Talks should discuss the techniques, code patterns or work flows that emerged from those large applications, whether they ended up causing maintenance or performance headaches or resulted in improved productivity and throughput.
* [ ] Rails Sans ActiveRecord - Not all Rails apps run with ActiveRecord. This track will discuss various ways of using Rails either without an ORM or with a different ORM as the data layer. Talks should touch on why you chose this setup, what it specifically looks like, and how it’s working for your team!
* [ ] "Soft" Skills Are Hard! - So-called "soft" skills are actually quite difficult for many engineers, and yet, they are a vital part of a functional workplace. Things like communication, collaboration, organization, or any other "people" skills don't come naturally for many of us. Talks in this track aim to educate about non-technical -- but nevertheless vital -- aspects of the job. Talks can include favorite management and/or leadership techniques, or simply just things you wish other programmers knew that would make any workplace better.

I am a software developer based out of Denver, Colorado. I currently work at Ibotta, a cash back for shopping mobile app whose mission is to save our users time and money. Before getting into the tech world, I worked in public K-12 education for 11 years in teaching, school leadership, and school consulting roles. I transitioned from education into technology by way of the Turing School of Software Design, a Denver based code school with a Ruby-centric curriculum.
