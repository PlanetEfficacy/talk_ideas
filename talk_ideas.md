## Session Format
Regular Session

## Track
Exported Expertise - What non-tech experiences have given you an unexpected expertise in tech? This track will feature narratives about how exported expertises have helped in your tech journeys. Some examples are how working at a restaurant shaped your architectural understanding, or how caring for kids taught you to be a pull request star.

## Abstract
##### A concise, engaging description for the public program. Limited to 600 characters.

In 2016 I abandoned a successful 11 year career in public education for the world of technology. Six months earlier my partner gave birth to twins so the personal stakes of this decision were immense. I constantly worried that as a new developer I would never catch up with others who entered the field through traditional pathways. What I've learned since then is that my status as a recovering educator is not a handicap, it's a super power. 

Lets look at the phenomena that is the teacher turned coder. We'll explore communication, planning and stress management practices in both school and software contexts. You'll leave with an increased mindfulness of your own practice as well as some potential next steps to further your own expertise in these areas.

## Details
##### Include any pertinent details such as outlines, outcomes or intended audience.

### Objective: Participants will be able to draw comparisons between teaching and programming in a way that provides them with either 1. increased awareness of their own practice or 2. next steps for improving their practice.

### Argument
- Educators make great software developers because of their expertise in: 
  1. Verbal communication 
  2. Written communication
  3. Planning
  4. Stress management

### Outline
#### Intro
- Provide context regarding the phenomenon of educators turned coders including short personal story accompanied by industry-wide statistics
- Introduce argument that educators make great software developers because of their expertise in verbal communication, written communication, planning and stress management
  - Potential venn diagram visual could be useful here.
- Describe the goal of the talk: We want to bring increased mindfullness to our own practice as software developers informed by anecdotes from teachers and best practice from the field of education

#### Verbal Communication
##### How educators develop effective verbal communication
  - Facilitating and leading classroom instruction
  - Students provide quick feedback when verbal communication is ineffective 
##### How verbal communication applies to software development
  - Technical presentations
  - Mentoring and onboarding new engineers
  - Explaining technical topics to technical and non technical audiences
#### Written Communication
##### How educators develop effective written communication
  - Authoring student facing instructional materials
  - Grading student work
  - Again, students provide quick feedback when written communication is ineffective
##### How written communication applies to software development
  - Pull request reviews
  - Formal documentation
  - Creating clear names for variables, methods, classes
#### Planning
##### How educators develop effective planning
  - Curriculum design involves goal setting and working backwards, systematically and incrementally
  - Educators plan under difficult constraints - time, student needs, external constraints (standardized testing etc)
    - Often this planning is done collaboratively with partner educators or in the context of teams of educators
##### How planning applies to software development
  - Planning complex technical projects happens collaboratively with teams of engineers, product mangers, and other stakeholders
  - Backwards planning is very similar to test driven development
#### Stress Management
##### How educators develop effective stress management
  - Schools are demanding, stressful, high stakes work environments
  - Students, parents and other eductors are demanding customers
##### How stress management applies to software development
  - Production bugs
  - On call rotations
  - Keeping the big picture in perspective
#### Conclusion and Q&A


## Pitch
##### Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic.

This talk should be on the 2020 Railsconf program because communication, planning, and stress management are hard. Understanding how these skills can be developed and practiced in a non-software context will empower participants to be more mindful of and potentiall even more effective in their own practice of communication, planning and stress management. If a group of 2020 Railsconf attendees leave the conference with ideas on how to be better themselves or help others improve in these areas, it will have been time well spent.

I am uniquely qualified to discuss the expertise that educators bring to coding because I have significant experience in K12 public education and as a professional software developer. Prior to becoming a software developer I was a middle school teacher, a middle school assistant principal, a high school assistant principal and an education consultant. During my eleven years in education the students, families, teachers, and administrators I worked with dramatically shaped who I am today, and thus the way I build software. I am now a senior engineer at Ibotta. I have delivered multiple projects with significant business impact and non trivial technical complexity. I have hired, onboarded, trained, and mentored new engineers. I bring a depth of experience in both education and software that I hope will be compelling for Railsconf attendees.

Furthermore, because I left a successful career in education, when I started working as a software engineer I felt like an imposter. I knew the education world had a lot to learn from software developers, which was one of the reasons I wanted to make a change. I worried that I was too far behind my colleagues to ever make a meaningful contribution to my team or advance in my new field. What I have learned in the three years since then is that I actually was not lagging behind, but rather brought strengths and previous expertise with me from my former career. I now know that the learning between educators and software developers can be bidirectional. And, I am so excited by the prospect of telling  the Rails community about my journey and what I've learned at Railsconf this year.

## Bio
##### Your bio should be short, no longer than 500 characters. It's related to why you're speaking about this topic.

Jesse Spevack is a father of twins, skier, marathoner, and Senior Platform Engineer at Ibotta, a cash back for shopping app whose mission is to *make every purchase rewarding*. Before getting into the tech world, Jesse worked in public K-12 education for 11 years in teaching, school leadership, and school consulting roles. Jesse transitioned from education into technology by way of the Turing School of Software Design, a Denver based code school with a Ruby-centric curriculum and deep ties to the Rails community.
