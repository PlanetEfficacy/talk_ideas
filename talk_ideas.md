## Title
Confessions of a Recovering Educator

## Session Format
Regular Session

## Track
Exported Expertise - What non-tech experiences have given you an unexpected expertise in tech? This track will feature narratives about how exported expertises have helped in your tech journeys. Some examples are how working at a restaurant shaped your architectural understanding, or how caring for kids taught you to be a pull request star.

## Abstract
##### A concise, engaging description for the public program. Limited to 600 characters. - no biographical info

How long is the line for the copy machine at your office each morning? When did a subordinate, superior or customer last yell at you? What is your company's bathroom break policy?

My status as a recovering educator may include some bitter memories, but it is not a handicap. It is a super power from which I've learned valuable communication and stress management skills that are highly applicable to our work in software. Let's explore the phenomenon that is the teacher-turned-coder by exploring what skills I brought from the classroom, how I applied them in the software development context, and most importantly how you can apply your own unseen and unknown skills to build better software more effectively.

# Outline / Plan

## Objective

Participants will be able to apply their own unseen and unknown skills to build better software more effectively.

## Communication

### What did you learn outside of your coding education, that you've brought to your software career?
Outside of my coding education I learned how to facilitate classroom instruction, give written feedback, mentor students and coach other educators, and work with parents and families.

### How did you export that expertise? What did you do to build on that skill when you needed it in software?
Many of these core communication functions above were applicable in my software development career. To build on these skills that I honed as an educator I sought out areas where they were needed and applicable, for example:
- Facilitating classroom instruction => Technical presentations
- Written feedback => Code review, documentation, naming things
- Mentoring new engineers => Coaching other educators & mentoring students, checking for understanding

## Planning

### What did you learn outside of your coding education, that you've brought to your software career?
Outside of my coding education I learned how to plan with the end in mind. For example, when planning a course of study, a unit, or even a single lesson I asked myself what should students be able to do or know at the end of this. From that point I would plan backwards, asking what is the thing that immediately proceeds achieving this goal and what proceeds that and so on.

### How did you export that expertise? What did you do to build on that skill when you needed it in software?
Planning is also a key piece of an educator's job that is analogous to the work of the developer at the micro and macro scales. To build on these skills that I honed as an educator I looked again for areas of the work that felt familiar.
- Test driven development is a form of planning with the end in mind.
- Project planning and systems design typically involves teams of educators, which is similar to working on a squad with other engineers and a product manager.

## Stress Management

### What did you learn outside of your coding education, that you've brought to your software career?
Educators face long hours, high stakes, and lots of competing demands for time and attention. You need to have stress management strategies in this kind of environment.

### How did you export that expertise? What did you do to build on that skill when you needed it in software?
Stress comes up in many fields and having experience in the high stakes education world helped me keep my work as a software developer in perspective even when facing the most stressful situations such as:
- Production bugs
- Getting stuck
- Project delays
- On call duty

## How might an attendee find and apply their unseen unknown skills, and export their expertise?
I think this is a key point so much of software development can feel alien at first so it is really important to hold on to the areas that are familiar that can anchor growth, learning, and productivity. Tips for finding and applying unseen unknown skills:
- What feels familiar about software development?
- What made your past work unique or interesting?

## Pitch
##### Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic.  - no biographical info

When I started work as a software engineer I felt like an imposter and this feeling was exacerbated by the fact that I had left a reasonably successful career in education. I knew the education world had a lot to learn from software developers, which was one of the reasons I wanted to make a change. I worried that I was too far behind my colleagues to ever make a meaningful contribution to my team or advance in my new field. What I have learned in the years since then is that I actually was not lagging behind, but rather brought strengths and previous expertise with me from my former career. I now know that the learning between educators and software developers can be bidirectional.

This talk should be on the 2020 Railsconf program because communication, planning, and stress management are hard. These are just some of the areas that I found familiar during my career transition. My hope is that by focusing on the idea of familiarity in the midst of the unknown I can help attendees find and apply their unseen and unknown skills.

I am uniquely qualified to discuss the expertise that educators bring to coding because I have significant experience in K12 public education and as a professional software developer. Prior to becoming a developer I was a middle school teacher, a middle school assistant principal, a high school assistant principal and an education consultant. During my years in education the students, families, teachers, and administrators I worked with dramatically shaped who I am today, and thus the way I build software. I am now a senior engineer. I have delivered projects with significant business impact and non trivial technical complexity. I have hired, on-boarded, trained, and mentored new engineers. I bring a depth of experience in both education and software that I hope will be compelling for Railsconf attendees.

I am so excited by the prospect of telling the Rails community about my journey, what I've learned in the process and most importantly offer encouragement to others who also have expertise to export.

## Bio
